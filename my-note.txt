This repo is made based on 
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-server-side-rendering.
So it's better to follow the article rather than just download this project.
But here is my note from my trial following the article.
By the way this is my first public repo so bare with me if it's not that clean.

I need to add some my own note how to make it works for my case using windows as my OS. 
I think it is also important to note that I made this on 30 Oct 2020.
Here are changes I made:
1. all the steps working pretty much just fine except the ones I put here
2. In package.json part, on the original post, they add
	"dev:build-server":"NODE_ENV=development webpack --config webpack.server.js --mode=development -w"
   But for my case the "NODE_ENV=development" did not work and I need to configure
   the environment manually, using SET NODE_ENV=development, or you can configure
   it using .env file if you like.
3. I think some libraries must be updated as for the start we use npx create-react-app.
   I forget whether I follow the version of "npx create-react-app@3.4.1 my-ssr-app" written
   on original post or not, but for my case I need to change webpack library version to be version 4.44.2
4. With those 2 parts changed (point 2 and 3), it should work.

And if some of you have tried the same article and have more understanding than I do, here are some of
my questions:
1. Why after I run "npm run dev" once, the next run does end, it tells me to wait for file change?
   Instead of running "npm run dev" I need to run "dev:start" as the "dev:build-server" is not required
   anymore(?) because we already made one from the first run. But I do not really know how it works,
   anyone can explain more?
2. How do we deploy this to real practical server?
